Before performing any data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we need to clean and preprocess the dataset. The dataset contains some columns with similar information and others that may not be relevant for analysis. We'll first clean the dataset and then perform EDA.

Here are the steps we'll follow:

Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicate and irrelevant columns.

Handle missing values.

Convert data types if necessary.

Rename columns for clarity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics.

Distribution of numerical variables.

Count of categorical variables.

Visualization (e.g., bar plots, histograms, box plots).
